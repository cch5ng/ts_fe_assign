# Notes to Reviewer

* I used npm to install and run the app.

* For the initial API fetch, I hard coded a query based on US region and getting movies releasing closest to the current date.

* If I had more time I'd work on:

   * Fix missing search icon (it was showing and then I lost it)

   * CSS, going through to see if it could be more DRY.

   * It should use pagination but not sure if that was required (?)

# Timescale Frontend Interview Assignment

![Screenshot](./src/images/screenshot.png)

You are tasked with building a movie discovery app built in react. This app will
display movies in a grid and give the user more information when they click on
one of the posters. To fetch the movie info, we will be using [The Movie DB][movieDB]
and will include the API key for you to add to the `.env` in the initial email.

### Features

The main features that should be implemented
- On the initial visit to the site, it will show the most recent movies
- Allow users to put in a search term and display the results in the same grid
- When a user clicks on one of the cards, open a modal and display more information about the movie


### The rules

- Follow the [designs in Figma][figma] as closely as possible
- Use **only** the packages provided in the package.json. You dont have to use all of them, 
  but we ask for you not to add any additional
- Site should have a simple responsive design
- Site should work in the latest Chrome on Mac OS
- Fork the repo to your own account, make it public and send us the repo url when you are completed. We will
  clone and run the site on our local.
